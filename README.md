# d3linechart (Jasper Report CVC)
A custom visualization component (CVC) for JasperStudio, based on a D3 linechart.
A sample report and a minimal HTTP server to provide timeseries data are included.

Build with Jaspersoft Studion (Community Edition, 6.4.0, http://community.jaspersoft.com/community-download)

To run the report, you need to install the WebService plugin (defines a REST data adapter) and
execute the server.js file (nodejs server.js).

The sample timeseries data can be inspected at http://localhost:8888
